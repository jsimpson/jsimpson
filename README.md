## Hi, I'm Jonathan!

### I'm a husband, father, and software engineer.

I have a little over a decade and a half of professional experience ranging from embedded devices (software-defined radios, LTE remote radio heads and base stations, RF amplifiers, etc...) to full-stack web applications and SPAs. I currently work in the telepresence robotics space and my day to day involves healthcare applications. I focus on distributed systems with an emphasis on performance, scalability, and concurrency. I also have a lot of experience with database design and data intensive systems and applications.

I am primarily working in JavaScript with some Ruby (I also have experience writing C extensions and using FFI) and SQL. I still write some C and C++ for fun. I have professional experience with PHP, C#, Python, Lua, bash and awk.

I'm currently engaged in broading my knowledge of C and C++ as well as slowly learning Rust. I'm also really enjoying spending time with TypeScript and Deno.
