Software Engineer with a decade and a half of experience ranging from embedded devices (software-defined radios, LTE remote radio heads and base stations, RF amplifiers, etc...) to full-stack web applications to SPAs. My employer is in the telepresence robotics space and my day to day, today, involves healthcare applications. I focus on distributed systems with an emphasis on performance, scalability, and concurrency. I also have a lot of experience with data intensive systems and applications.

Like most Software Engineers in California, I am also a co-founder to a fledgling start-up. [EyesOnHives](https://www.eyesonhives.com/) is a technology company with a mission to accelerate the transition to sustainable agriculture. Our team has developed best in class technology and a suite of algorithms to quantify honey bee activity with edge computing IoT video analytics.

I primarily work in Ruby (with a depth of experience writing C extensions and using FFI), C, C++, and JS/TS.

I'm currently engaged in broading my knowledge of C and C++ as well as slowly learning Rust.
