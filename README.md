Software Engineer with a decade and a half of experience ranging from embedded devices (software-defined radios, LTE remote radio heads and base stations, RF amplifiers, etc...) to full-stack web applications to SPAs. I currently work in the telepresence robotics space and my day to day, today, involves healthcare applications. I focus on distributed systems with an emphasis on performance, scalability, and concurrency. I also have a lot of experience with database design and data intensive systems and applications.

I primarily work in Ruby (with a depth of experience writing C extensions and using FFI), C, C++, JS/TS, and SQL. I have professional experience with PHP, Python, Lua, bash and awk.

I'm currently engaged in broading my knowledge of C and C++ as well as slowly learning Rust.
